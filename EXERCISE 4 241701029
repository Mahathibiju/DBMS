-- 1. Identify the errors in the given query

-- Correct example using EMP table:
SELECT id AS employee_id,
       last_name,
       12 * 1000 AS "ANNUAL SALARY"
FROM EMP;


-- 2. Show the structure of DEPT table and select all data from it
DESC DEPT;
SELECT * FROM DEPT;


-- 3. Display last name, job code, hire date, and employee number,
--    employee number first  
--    (Your tables do NOT have job_id or hire_date, so using MY_EMPLOYEE)
SELECT ID AS employee_number,
       Last_name,
       NULL AS job_code,
       NULL AS hire_date
FROM MY_EMPLOYEE;


-- 4. Provide alias STARTDATE for hire date
--    (Your tables do NOT have hire_date → using NULL placeholder)
SELECT ID,
       Last_name,
       NULL AS STARTDATE
FROM MY_EMPLOYEE;


-- 5. Display UNIQUE job codes
--    (Your schema has NO job_id column, so this must be adjusted)
--    Showing unique USERID instead
SELECT DISTINCT Userid
FROM MY_EMPLOYEE;


-- 6. Concatenate last_name with Userid (comma + space)
--    Name the column EMPLOYEE_AND_TITLE
SELECT Last_name || ', ' || Userid AS EMPLOYEE_AND_TITLE
FROM MY_EMPLOYEE;


-- 7. Display all data from MY_EMPLOYEE table as one comma-separated column
--    Name the column THE_OUTPUT
SELECT ID || ', ' ||
       Last_name || ', ' ||
       First_name || ', ' ||
       Userid || ', ' ||
       Salary AS THE_OUTPUT
FROM MY_EMPLOYEE;
